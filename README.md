# RepresentsMe 

Engaging voters from Objective-C to Shining Sea ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

## About

RepresentsMe is an iOS app that aims to bring its users closer to the people
that represent them at all levels of government. It provides a way for users to
easily see who represents them from the national level all the way down to the
local level. Users can navigate through a map to view the officials at any
location within the fifty states that make up the United States. Additionally,
the app facilitates organizing events related to any official as users can
create events that their fellow users can attend.
